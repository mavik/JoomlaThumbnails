# AI Rules

1. Do not modify files in the `joomla` directory.
2. Do not modify files in `mavik-thumbnails/libraries/masterminds/html5-php`
3. Do not add `@param` or `@return` to PHPDoc if it doesn't add new information that is not already present in the function declaration (e.g., if types are already specified).
